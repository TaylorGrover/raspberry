digits: Landing directory for image collection
data: Contains three directories: training, testing, validation, which each 
	contain 10 directories labeled from 0 - 9.
	
fix_images.py: Runs on the capturing device; greyscales the images, then resizes
	the images to 28x28 pixels, then saves the images to large binary file. The
	format of this binary file is simple: the greyscaled image pixels are stored
	serially, 784 bytes each.
	
At a later stage, the greyscale png files will be stuffed into a binary file 
which will be used for easy data extraction.

Potential issues with training on makeshift dataset:
	âˆ™ Too much variation for sparse data
		- Luminescence 
		- Spatial Position
		- Orientation
		- Geometry of written digit
		- Background noise
		- Image capture distance
		- Digit shading
